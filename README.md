## 🔍 Project objective : 

AtliQ Hardware is a global supplier of computer hardware and peripherals. The company faced challenges with data and manual assumptions that limited their ability to make timely, data-driven decisions.


In this project, I transformed raw data into actionable business insights using **MySQL, Excel, Power Query,** and **DAX** calculations in **Power BI**. Resulting in **interactive** and **user-friendly dashboards** that empower teams to make smarter decisions with confidence.🎯




**🔹 Data Preprocessing & Transformation**

-  Built a custom date table in Power Query
-	 Cleaned, merged, and appended tables using Power Query’s M formula language
-	 Created a unified table combining actuals and estimates
-	 Validated data against benchmark numbers
-	 Implemented Query Folding for optimal performance


**🔹 Data Modeling & Optimization**
-	Connected fact and dimension tables to create a **Star Schema**
- Calculated key metrics: post-invoice deductions, net sales, total COGS, etc.
